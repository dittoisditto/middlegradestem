<h3>Helen Wu</h3>
<h4>co-founder</h4>
<p>Hi! My name is Helen, and I am a sophomore at Panther Creek High School with a 4.44 weighted GPA. I will be teaching/assisting the public classes. My extracurricular activities include game design, programming, and digital art. I am also currently in the process of designing a personal indie game. </p>
<p>I have received high A's as of my high school career thus far, including subjects such as precalculus, biology, etc. I began learning programming and coding in middle school, and I am well-versed in Python, HTML/CSS, and a little Java.</p>
<p>I believe middle school is the ideal time to begin learning programming and coding principles. Beginning those few crucial steps into the STEM world can be difficult, so I am here to make sure it isn't as harrowing for future STEM enthusiasts! Hope to see you in class!</p>

<h3>Sarayu Kondaveeti</h3>
<h4>co-founder</h4>
<p>Hi! My name is Sarayu. I will be teaching/assisting the public classes. I began learning how to program at the beginning of high school therefore I am versed in Python and currently learning Java.</p>
<p>I'm a sophomore at Green Level High School. I have a 4.0 unweighted GPA (4.375 weighted), and have been achieving A's in all of my classes since 6th grade. </p>
<p>I believe middle school is the ideal time to develop a solid academic foundation and for students interested in STEM to be introduced to its different aspects. The opportunity to do so shouldn't have money as a barrier, and to make these things more accessible, all the services offered by Middle Grade STEM are free. </p>
<p>In addition to my academics, I play the violin, commission digital art, play softball and have a job with the Town of Cary!</p>

<p>Hi! My name is Anjali. I will be teaching the HTML/CSS course this semester. I am a sophomore at Panther Creek High School, and I have made all Aâ€™s since middle school. I have taken several computer science-related courses throughout my schooling including an HTML course in e8th grade and a python course in 9th. I continue to do so by taking Python 2 and AP Computer Principles this year.</p>
<p>Middle School is the right time to start exposing yourself to different career options. Middle-Grade STEM offers a free guide to delving into differing avenues of stem related career!</p>
<p>I also like to get involved in clubs at school such as MUN, Key Club, and TSA. Outside of school, I love to read and play my guitar.</p>
