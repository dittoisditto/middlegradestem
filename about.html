<h3>Helen Wu</h3>
<h4>co-founder</h4>
<p>Hi! My name is Helen, and I am a sophomore at Panther Creek High School with a 4.44 weighted GPA. <!--I will be teaching/assisting the public classes.--> My extracurricular activities include game design, programming, and digital art. I am also currently in the process of designing a personal indie game. </p>
<p>I have received high A's as of my high school career thus far, including subjects such as precalculus, biology, etc. I began learning programming and coding in middle school, and I am well-versed in Python, HTML/CSS, and a little Java.</p>
<p>I believe middle school is the ideal time to begin learning programming and coding principles. Beginning those few crucial steps into the STEM world can be difficult, so I am here to make sure it isn't as harrowing for future STEM enthusiasts! Hope to see you in class!</p>

<h3>Sarayu Kondaveeti</h3>
<h4>co-founder</h4>
<p>Hi! My name is Sarayu. I will be teaching/assisting the public classes. I began learning how to program at the beginning of high school therefore I am well-versed in Java and Python.</p>
<p>I'm a sophomore at Green Level High School. I have a 4.0 unweighted GPA (4.375 weighted), and have been achieving A's in all of my classes since 6th grade. </p>
<p>I believe middle school is the ideal time to develop a solid academic foundation and for students interested in STEM to be introduced to its different aspects. The opportunity to do so shouldn't have money as a barrier, and to make these things more accessible, all the services offered by Middle Grade STEM are free. </p>
<p>In addition to my academics, I play the violin, commission digital art, play softball and have a job with the Town of Cary!</p>

<h3>Devika Venugopalan</h3>
<h4>instructor</h4>
<p>Hi! My name is Devika, and I am a sophomore at Panther Creek High School. I will be one of the tutors.</p>
<p>I have made all high A's in my classes since middle school. Math is my favorite subject, and I have already taken 4 high school math courses as of my freshman year, them being NC Math 1, Math 2, Math 3, and Precalculus. I will be taking AP Calculus this upcoming school year. </p>
<p>I believe Middle School is when students get introduced to many new math concepts that will be used in their math classes throughout high school. These concepts tend to build on each other, so it is very important to understand everything fully before moving onto the next level. Middle-Grade STEM allows students to get any help they need in their math classes or stay ahead of the game, for free!</p>
<p>In school, I participate in several clubs, like Key Club, TSA, Science Club, and Math Club. Outside of school, I enjoy reading, doing art, playing the piano, and dancing.</p>

<h3>Eric Liu</h3>
<h4>instructor</h4>
<p>Hello, my name is Eric, and I am a 10th grader attending Panther Creek High School. I will be helping out with teaching programming classes. Knowledge of programming, a very expansive and powerful tool, is extremely helpful in aiding one’s understanding of today’s world, and I am glad that I can share some knowledge in this regard.</p>
<p>Outside of school I enjoy programming, one which I attend to in my extracurricular activities as well. It is one of my interests, and I have decided to pursue it out of school by being part of a community FIRST Robotics team. In terms of programming, I have tinkered with Java, .NET C#, and Python. You’ll find some of my public projects on my GitHub at <a href="github.com/ericliu0000">github.com/ericliu0000</a>. Another interest of mine is FDM 3D printing, which is a really helpful tool, whether it is used for parts on a robot, or for 3D printing face shields to help with a lack of supply during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
