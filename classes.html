					<td>Public classes are open to anyone in grades 5-9. They are hosted on Sunday afternoons (at varying times). Subjects covered include Python Programming, Website Design, Java, and Game Design. Registration is open for any public class as soon as it is listed on this page. The frequency of each class depends on student interest. Special master classes in other subjects may sometimes be offered!</td>
					<td>Private tutoring will be 1-on-1 sessions between an instructor and the student. Subjects covered will mainly be Math and Science. Note: private sessions are NOT on a weekly/daily basis and are only to help a student with either their homework, or a specific concept that they aren't understanding in class. These sessions are NOT classes, meaning we cannot teach the entirety of the subject for the student. Timings will vary depending on the availability of the student and the instructor.</td>
