					<h2>Private Classes</h2>
					<p>Private tutoring will be 1-on-1 sessions between an instructor and the student. Subjects covered will mainly be Math and Science. Note: private sessions are NOT on a weekly/daily basis and are only to help a student with either their homework, or a specific concept that they aren't understanding in class. These sessions are NOT classes, meaning we cannot teach the entirety of the subject for the student. Timings will vary depending on the availability of the student and the instructor.</p>
