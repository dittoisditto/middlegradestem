					<h2>Public Classes</h2>
					<p>Public classes are open to anyone in grades 5-9. They are hosted on Sunday afternoons (at varying times). Subjects covered include Python Programming, Website Design, Java, and Game Design. Registration is open for any public class as soon as it is listed on this page. The frequency of each class depends on student interest. Special master classes in other subjects may sometimes be offered!</p>
					<p><b>REGISTRATION FOR SEMESTER ONE PUBLIC CLASSES CLOSES SEPT. 6, 2020</b></p>
					<div class="class-desc">
						<h3>Python</h3>
						<p>These weekly python classes will run for the duration of the first semester, for one hour each Sunday afternoon. In this time, we will cover executing the "Hello World!" command to writing basic programs!</p>
					</div>

					<div class="class-desc">
						<h3>Website Design</h3>
						<p>In these weekly website design classes, which will also run for the duration of the first semester, students will learn how to use HTML and CSS to create a functioning, well-designed website. </p></div>


					<h2>Private Classes</h2>
					<p>Private tutoring will be 1-on-1 sessions between an instructor and the student. Subjects covered will mainly be Math and Science. Note: private sessions are NOT on a weekly/daily basis and are only to help a student with either their homework, or a specific concept that they aren't understanding in class. These sessions are NOT classes, meaning we cannot teach the entirety of the subject for the student. Timings will vary depending on the availability of the student and the instructor.</p>
